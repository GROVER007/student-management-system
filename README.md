# Student Management System

This is a program of student management system. 
This can be used to maintain an organised record of students of particular class.
This program generally create an csv file from which some data is imported to the screen and when the data is imported we update, add, remove the records and can save back it to csv file.
Here user get to see a very attractive and beautiful interface.
the interface is very user-friendly and is designed in such a way so that user can do whatever they want easily and effictively.
This program is tested and i tried my best to keep it error-free

Here are some screenshots of interface :
